A web app where patients can discover 
============================================================================================
features - 
view available time slots, 
book appointments
Doctors manage their calendars (clinic hours, breaks, leaves)
admins oversee the whole system.
============================================================================================
valoidations -
double-booking, 
clinic hours vs. doctor availability, 
buffer times, 
last-minute cancellations.
============================================================================================
Key Features-
Patient signup
patient login (JWT), profile
Doctor profiles (specialization, fees, clinic locations)
SmartSlot™ generator (unique logic): produces bookable slots from working hours + breaks + buffer + already-booked + doctor leave + per-slot capacity
Real-time conflict-free booking (DB-level unique index)
Appointment lifecycle: Book → Confirm → Cancel/Reschedule
Doctor dashboard (today’s schedule, next patient)
Admin panel (manage doctors, specialties, clinics)
Email template hooks (optional)
Audit logs (simple)

Auth (JWT)-done
Register (Patient/Doctor)-done
Login, token storage, protected routes-done
Doctors-done
Search by name/specialization
Profile with fee, bio, clinics
Clinics
Address, association with doctors
Doctor Schedules
Working hours per day (start/end, slot length, buffer)
Breaks (e.g., lunch)
Leaves (full or partial day)
SmartSlot™
Generates availability for a date by combining working hours, breaks, leaves, and existing bookings.
Respects buffer times to avoid back-to-back crowding.
Appointments
Patient can book, view, cancel
Double booking impossible via DB unique index (DoctorId, StartUtc)
Dashboards
Doctor: today’s schedule & upcoming patients
Patient: my appointments
Admin (phase 2)
Manage doctors, clinics, specialties
(Optional)
Email/SMS reminders
Online/offline consult types
Payments integration (mock first)

Process flow - 

🔹 Process Flow of the Project
1. User Onboarding
Patient registers → enters name, email, password → system stores in DB → returns JWT token for authentication.
Doctor registers (or admin creates doctor profile) → enters specialization, fees, clinic location, working hours.
Admin is a super-user who can add/remove doctors, clinics, and manage data.

2. Doctor Schedule Setup
Doctor defines:
Working hours (e.g., Mon–Fri, 10am–2pm & 5pm–8pm).
Breaks (e.g., lunch 2–5pm).
Buffer time (e.g., 10 mins gap between patients).
Leaves / holidays (e.g., not available on 25 Aug).
Slot capacity (e.g., max 2 patients per slot for group sessions).
⚡ Here the SmartSlot™ Generator runs and calculates all available slots based on the above rules.
These slots are saved/cached so patients only see conflict-free times.

3. Patient Browsing & Booking
Patient searches doctor by specialization (e.g., “Dermatologist”).
Selects doctor → sees profile, fees, clinic location, and available slots (from SmartSlot).
Patient picks a time slot → system checks in DB if:
Slot is free
Doctor not on leave
Not already booked (DB unique index check)
✅ If free → Booking created.
❌ If conflict → Error returned instantly.

4. Appointment Lifecycle
Book: Patient books → status = "Booked".
Confirm: Doctor (or auto-confirm) marks it confirmed → status = "Confirmed".
Cancel: Patient or Doctor cancels → slot becomes free again.
Reschedule: Patient requests → selects another slot → old one freed.

5. Dashboards
Doctor Dashboard:
Today’s schedule (list of patients, times, status).
Next upcoming patient.
Option to mark attended / missed.
Patient Dashboard:
My appointments (Booked, Confirmed, Cancelled).
Option to cancel/reschedule.
Admin Dashboard:
Manage doctors, clinics, specialties.
Monitor bookings, cancellations.
Audit logs (who did what & when).

6. Notifications (optional but useful)
Email / SMS hooks:
Appointment booked → patient & doctor notified.
Reminder before appointment.
Cancellation/reschedule alerts.

7. Audit Logs
Every action (login, booking, cancellation, reschedule) gets logged → useful for debugging & tracking.
🔹 In Short (End-to-End Journey)
Doctor sets availability → SmartSlot generates valid slots.
Patient signs up → searches doctor → picks slot.
System validates & books without conflicts.
Appointment goes through lifecycle (Book → Confirm → Cancel/Reschedule).
Dashboards keep doctors, patients, and admins updated.
Notifications + logs keep the process smooth and transparent.

👉 So overall, the core engine is SmartSlot™ + conflict-free DB booking, and the rest (dashboards, notifications, logs) are supporting modules.
